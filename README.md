## Simple Linear Regression

### Description
This project demonstrates a very basic regression task using linear regression. It helps you understand the fundamental concept of predicting a continuous output variable based on one or more input features.

### Features
- Simple linear regression implementation
- Visualization of the regression line
- Step-by-step explanation of the regression process

### Usage
```python
python regression.py


# Classification with CIFAR10

## Description
Discover the world of image classification with the CIFAR10 dataset, the dataset that popularized the field of deep learning. This project involves training a neural network to classify handwritten digits.

## Features
- Neural network implementation for classification
- Handling of image data and preprocessing
- Evaluation of model accuracy

## Usage
```python
python classification.py


# Text Generation with LSTM

## Description
Explore the capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks by generating text. This project showcases how LSTMs can be used to learn from sequences of data and generate coherent text.

## Features
- LSTM network for text generation
- Training on a text dataset
- Generation of new text sequences

## Usage
```python
python textgeneration.py


### Transformer Model

```markdown
# Versatile Transformer Model

## Description
Transformers are the backbone of many state-of-the-art models in natural language processing and other fields. This project provides a versatile Transformer model that can be adapted for various tasks such as translation, summarization, and more.

## Features
- Transformer architecture implementation
- Versatile application to different tasks
- Detailed explanation of Transformer components

## Usage
```python
python transformer.py
